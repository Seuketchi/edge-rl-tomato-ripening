Edge-RL Thesis Implementation & Expansion Plan1. Thesis Structure (Chapter 1 - 4)Chapter 1: IntroductionBackground: High post-harvest losses in the Philippines (often >30% for tomatoes). High cost of industrial ripening chambers ($10k-$50k).Problem Statement: Smallholder farmers lack access to precision ripening technology due to prohibitive costs and lack of cloud/internet connectivity in rural areas.Objectives:Develop a standalone ripening system with a $33 BOM using the ESP32-S3.Implement an RL policy that generalizes across cultivars using domain randomization.Achieve >95% policy distillation fidelity to enable edge inference.Scope & Limitations: * Single-Fruit Focus: Specifically monitors and controls the ripening of one tomato unit to isolate kinetic variables.Heater-Only: Actuation is limited to a heating relay; no active cooling (Peltier/Compressor).Exclusions: Does not account for batch ethylene gas interactions or humidity-driven ripening factors.Chapter 2: Review of Related Literature (RRL)Biological Kinetics: Focus on the "Diamante Max" and "Kamatis Tagalog" varieties. Reference UPLB (PHTRC) studies on color development and shelf-life under tropical temperatures.Reinforcement Learning in Agriculture: Comparative analysis of DQN vs. standard PID/Heuristic controllers for climate-sensitive process control.Edge AI & Model Compression: Analysis of Knowledge Distillation and INT8 Quantization techniques, specifically focusing on ESP-DL vs. TFLite Micro for Xtensa architectures.Chapter 3: MethodologyDigital Twin Construction: Implementation of the first-order ripening ODE ($\frac{dX}{dt}=-k_{1}\cdot(T-T_{basc})\cdot X$) and the ROYG spectral mapping.AI Pipeline: Training the 256x256 Teacher DQN in Python -> Supervised distillation into a 64x64 MLP Student -> ESP-PPQ Quantization.Hardware Design: XPS foam enclosure design, 12V/60W relay circuitry, and FreeRTOS task scheduling (Core 1 for Vision/Inference, Core 0 for Sensors/Comms).Chapter 4: Results and DiscussionSystem Performance: Evaluation of Mean Reward, Timing Error (days), and Quality Score against baselines.Ablation Study: Quantifying the performance impact of using Scalar-only states vs. Full Feature (spatial) states.Sim-to-Real Analysis: Measuring the "Reality Gap" through physical validation, aiming for <20% deviation in harvest timing.2. RRL Expansion: Philippine Varieties & ResearchGrounding the thesis in local agriculture is critical. Research these specific variety-driven kinetics:Diamante Max F1 (Hybrid): * Context: The most widely planted variety in the PH due to heat tolerance.Kinetics: Find UPLB studies on "Color Index (CI) 1-6" transitions for Diamante. Use this to set your $k_1$ constant accurately (likely around $0.08$ to $0.09$ in the PH climate).Kamatis Tagalog (Native): * Context: Highly perishable, thinner skin, smaller size.Comparison: Contrast its faster ripening rate with Diamante to show the RL agent's adaptability.Key Research Search Terms:"Postharvest physicochemical changes Diamante Max tomato PHTRC UPLB""Visual Quality Rating (VQR) of tomatoes under Philippine ambient conditions""Thermal lag and respiration rates of single-unit tomato fruits"3.

Immediate Implementation TasksVariety Selection: Commit to "Diamante Max" as your primary cultivar.Physical Calibration: Perform a "Visual Calibration" to ensure your chamber's LED lighting doesn't "wash out" the red levels, leading to false $X$ readings.Baseline Run: Run a 48-hour "Passive" test (Heater OFF) with a real tomato to determine your base $k_1$ for your specific chamber and variety.
